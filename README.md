# Angular Canvas Image Organizer

This Angular project facilitates the creation and organization of rectangular areas on a canvas based on user-defined horizontal and vertical lines. 
Users input the number of lines, answer questions about line distances, and dynamically draw rectangles on the canvas. Each area is sequentially numbered. 
Users can upload images to specific areas, and the loaded image is displayed within the specified boundaries. 
The system allows users to manage and modify data, retrieving and editing information related to previously created areas.
